alien-console
==============

This is a ncurses-based application which emulates the terminal application
shown in Alien: Isolation. When you combine this with a terminal emulator that
focuses on a retro look (like [Cool Retro Term][]), it doesn't look that far
off!

These use Cool Retro Term with a theme I came up with to match the Alien
computers.
